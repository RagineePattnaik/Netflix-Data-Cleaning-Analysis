# Netflix-Data-Cleaning-Analysis
We will implement an end to end ELT project. ELT stands for Extract, Load and Transform . We will use Netflix dataset to clean and analyze the data using SQL and Python. 
Used ETL tools (Talend, Apache NiFi) to extract data from APIs and flat files.
Transformed data using SQL queries and automated the process with scheduled jobs.
# Impact: Improved integration process efficiency by 20%, leading to faster decision-making
